The VL53L5CX from STMicro is an interesting multi zone range sensor. I've been using the older VL53L0CX for years as a large distance touchless sensor and range sensor but the new VL53L5CX does the same job but can see the range of serveral different objects all at the same time broken down into zones. These values can be displayed as pixels showing as a very low resolution camera.
